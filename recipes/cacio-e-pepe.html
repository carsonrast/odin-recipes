    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Cacio e Pepe is a classic Roman dish consisting of only 3 ingredients.  It's name
        literally translates to "cheese and pepper."  A little technique is required, but
        with practice, you can make your own super creamy pasta that explodes with flavor. 
    </p>
    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup freshly grated Pecorino Romano cheese*</li>
        <li>1/2 lb. dried spaghetti</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon whole black peppercorns</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="disc">*other hard, nutty cheeses will work, such as Parmeggiano Reggiano, but classic
        Cacio e Pepe uses only Pecorino Pomano, which is a very flavorful sheep's milk cheese.

    <ol>
        <li>Bring 2 qt of water to a boil.</li>
        <li>While waiting on the water to boil, in a hot skillet, toast the peppercorns until fragrant,
            about 30 seconds. Place peppercorns in a pepper mill for grinding later.</li>
        <li>Once water is boiling, add in the pasta.  Cook according to box instructions for al dente.</li>
        <li>One minute before pasta reaches al dente, use tongs to remove it from the boiling water and place in
            a skillet over medium-low heat. It's ok to not drain the pasta - the pasta water is needed
            for bringing the sauce together.
        </li>
        <li>Add about 1/8 cup of the pasta water to the pan and swirl to bring the temperature down.
            Add in about a third of the grated cheese and immediately toss vigorously.
        </li>
        <li>Continue to add the remaining cheese and stir continuously until the sauce thickens slightly.
             If the sauce becomes too thick, add a little more pasta water.
        </li>
        <li>Grind in the black pepper and stir.</li>
        <li>Serve on a pre-warmed plate and eat right away - the sauce will start to stiffen in about 15 minutes.</li>
    </ol>
